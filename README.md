# Design_Thinking_Data_Products - building
Repository designed for the course "Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products" at the University of California San Diego.

Here, you will find the notebooks from the course lectures, which provide introductory and practical examples of machine learning applications in projects. Additionally, you can explore my Final Project, where I developed two machine learning models from scratch: one for regression and another for classification.

## About Final Project

### Regression Problem

For this challenge, I am developing a regression model to predict cars' fuel consumption in kilometers per liter. The dataset can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to repository](https://github.com/elloa/ocean-machineLearning2018/tree/master/problema1).

### Classification Problem

Here I am working on a classification model that aims to predict expense categories, based on previously labeled bank transaction data. This model will be implemented in my job, so I will be using a fictitious dataset.

The problem I am trying to solve: with this model, I expect to enhance mine and my workmates performance by automating the manual task of classify bank transactions daily. We work with financial data from multiple clients, and we provide them information about their expenses so they can have full control on their monthly financial planning.

I have trained bank transactions data from the past 6 months. The labels are classifying expenses into the following categories:
