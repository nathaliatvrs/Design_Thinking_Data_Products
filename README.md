# Design_Thinking_Data_Products
Repository designed for the course "Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products" at the University of California San Diego.

Here, you will find the notebooks from the course lectures, which provide introductory and practical examples of machine learning applications in projects. Additionally, you can explore my Final Project, where I developed two machine learning models from scratch: one for regression and another for classification.
